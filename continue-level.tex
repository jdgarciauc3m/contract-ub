\section{A new level: continue}
\label{sec:continue}

In some situations it is desirable to combine in a single translation units
multiple contracts where:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Some contracts are checked and, when not satisfied, result in
		program termination (after executing the violation handler).
	\item Some contracts are checked and, when not satisfied, result in
		program continuation (after executing the violation handler).
\end{itemize}

To distinguish this situation, we propose a new level
\cppkey{continue}\footnote{Othe names for the level are possible (e.g.
\cppkey{check\_maybe\_continue}).}.
The semantics for this new level are derived from
\cppkey{check\_maybe\_continue} presented in~\cite{p1332r0}.

\begin{lstlisting}
void f(int * p)
  [[expects: p!=nullptr]]
  [[expects continue: *p>0]]
{
  g(*p);
}
\end{lstlisting}

When the build mode is \cppid{default} a violation of the first check will
result in program termination, while a violation to the second check will result
in continuation.

\begin{lstlisting}
void h() {
  f(nullptr);  // Violation. Termination.

  int r = 1;
  f(&r);       // Everything OK.

  int s = -1;
  f(&r);       // Violation. Continuation.
}
\end{lstlisting}
