\section{Summary}

This paper proposes the following changes to the current wording for contracts:

\begin{itemize}

\item Clarifies assumption of \cppkey{default} and \cppkey{audit} contracts by
ensuring that a contract that is not evaluated cannot be used for any kind of
assumption. Morever if such contract has been evaluated it can be assumed only
when the continuation mode has been disabled.

\item Adds a new \emph{axiom mode} that is used to determine if axioms may be
assumed or not.

\item Removes the ability to enable as a build option the continuation after a 
	contract has failed. In explanation it removes the continuation mode.

\item Allows the possibility that a specific contract check can be specified
	(by stating so in code) to continue in case of failure.

\end{itemize}
