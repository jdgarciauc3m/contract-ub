\section{Summary}

This paper proposes the following changes to the current wording for contracts:

\begin{itemize}

\item Clarifies assumption of \cppkey{default} and \cppkey{audit} contracts by
ensuring that a contract that is not evaluated cannot be used for any kind of
assumption. Morever if such contract has been evaluated it can be assumed only
when the continuation mode has been disabled.

\item Adds a new \emph{axiom mode} that is used to determine if axioms may be
assumed or not.

\item Add a new \emph{contract level} named \cppkey{continue} to mark contracts
that continue execution after violation regardless the continuation mode.

\item Add a new \emph{build mode} (named \cppid{minimal}) where only \cppkey{continue} contracts
are evaluated.

\end{itemize}
