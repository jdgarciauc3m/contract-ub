\section{Summary}

This paper proposes the following changes to the current wording for contracts:

\begin{itemize}

\item Clarifies assumption of \cppkey{default} and \cppkey{audit} contracts by
ensuring that a contract that is not evaluated cannot be used for any kind of
assumption. Morever if such contract has been evaluated it can be assumed only
when the continuation mode has been disabled.

\end{itemize}
