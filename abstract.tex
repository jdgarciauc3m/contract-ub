The current wording for contracts opens some opportunities for undefined behavior.
Those opportunities derive from the freedom for assuming a contract even when the
program is built in a mode where the contract has not been checked.
This paper proposes a minimal set of changes to solve the issue by requiring that
only contracts that have been checked can be assumed. Additionally, this paper
proposes an additional build option to decide whether axioms are assumed or not.
Finally this paper also proposes simplifications on the ability to continue
after a contract check has failed.
