\begin{abstract}
The current wording for contracts opens some opportunities for undefined behavior.
Those opportunities derive from the freedom for assuming a contract even when the
program is built in a mode where the contract has not been checked.
This paper proposes a minimal set of changes to solve the issue by requiring that
only contracts that have been checked can be assumed.
