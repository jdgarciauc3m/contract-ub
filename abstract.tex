The current wording for contracts opens some opportunities for undefined behavior.
Those opportunities derive from the freedom for assuming a contract even when the
program is built in a mode where the contract has not been checked.
This paper proposes a minimal set of changes to solve the issue by requiring that
only contracts that have been checked can be assumed. Additionally, this paper
proposes an additional build option to decide whether axioms are assumed or not.
Although this is the current status, there is a concerted effort to evolve from
this status to a proposal that can be supported by all authors of the original
design and specification of contracts.
