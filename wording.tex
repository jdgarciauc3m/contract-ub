\section{Proposed wording}

\subsection{Part I: Avoiding undefined behavior}

In section \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/4}, edit as follows:

\vspace{2em}

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent4. \remove{During constant expression evaluation (7.7), only
predicates of checked contracts are evaluated. In other
contexts, it is unspecified whether the predicate for a
contract that is not checked under the current build level is
evaluated; if the predicate of such a contract would evaluate
to false, the behavior is undefined.}
\add{Only predicates of checked contracts under current build
level are evaluated.}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}

\vspace{2em}

After \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/4}, add a new paragraph:

\vspace{2em}

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent5. \add{Unless the \emph{build level} is \emph{off} it is unspecified
whether the predicate for an \emph{axiom} contract is evaluated; if the
predicate of such a contract would evaluate to false, the behavior is undefined.}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}

After \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/7}, add a new paragraph:

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent8. \add{When the violation continuation mode is set to \emph{on} no predicate
of an \texttt{audit} or \texttt{default} contract will be assumed}\footnote{Authors 
recognize that this paragraph has a better wording}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}

\subsection{Part II: A new axiom build mode}

In section \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/3]}, edit as follows:

\vspace{2em}

{\addtolength{\leftskip}{5em}
A translation may be performed with one of the following \emph{build levels}: 
\emph{off},\add{\emph{axiom}}, \emph{default}, or \emph{audit}. 
A translation with build level set to \emph{off} \add{or \emph{axiom}} performs no checking for any contract.
A translation with build level set to \emph{default} performs checking for \textbf{\texttt{default}} contracts. 
A translation with build level set to \emph{audit} performs checking for \textbf{\texttt{default}} and 
\textbf{\texttt{audit}} contracts. 
If no build level is explicitly selected, the build level is \emph{default}. 
The mechanism for selecting the build level is implementation-defined. 
The translation of a program consisting of translation units where the build level is not the same in all translation units is conditionally-supported. 
There should be no programmatic way of setting, modifying, or querying the build level of a translation unit.
