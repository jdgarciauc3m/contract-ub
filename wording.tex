\section{Proposed wording}
\label{sec:wording}

In this section a (probably incomplete) wording is presented.
This will be refined before the Kona meeting.

\subsection{Part I: Avoiding undefined behavior}

In section \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/4}, edit as follows:

\vspace{2em}

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent4. \remove{During constant expression evaluation (7.7), only
predicates of checked contracts are evaluated. In other
contexts, it is unspecified whether the predicate for a
contract that is not checked under the current build level is
evaluated; if the predicate of such a contract would evaluate
to false, the behavior is undefined.}
\add{Only predicates of checked contracts under current build
level are evaluated.}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}
