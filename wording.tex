\section{Proposed wording}

In this section we present a (probably incomplete) wording.
This will be refined before the Kona meeting.

\subsection{Part I: Avoiding undefined behavior}

In section \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/4}, edit as follows:

\vspace{2em}

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent4. \remove{During constant expression evaluation (7.7), only
predicates of checked contracts are evaluated. In other
contexts, it is unspecified whether the predicate for a
contract that is not checked under the current build level is
evaluated; if the predicate of such a contract would evaluate
to false, the behavior is undefined.}
\add{Only predicates of checked contracts under current build
level are evaluated.}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}

\vspace{2em}

\subsection{Part II: A new axiom mode}

After \textbf{[dcl.attr.contract.check]/4}, add a new paragraph:

\begin{flushright}
\begin{minipage}[t]{0.9\textwidth}
\noindent5. \add{A translation may be performed with an \emph{axiom mode}
which can be either \emph{off} or \emph{on}.
Unless the \emph{axiom level} is \emph{off} it is unspecified
whether the predicate for an \emph{axiom} contract is evaluated; if the
predicate of such a contract would evaluate to false, the behavior is undefined.}
\end{minipage}
\end{flushright}
